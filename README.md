# C++ Module 07

This module introduces C++ templates by implementing generic functions and a custom array class. It explores how to write type-agnostic, reusable code.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./whatever
```
📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./iter
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./array
```

## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — Start with a few functions:
Implement function templates swap(), min(), and max() that work on any type supporting comparison and assignment. Test with both integers and strings.

ex01 — Iter:
Implement a template function iter() that applies a given function to each element of an array. It must handle both const and non-const arrays and support any type.

ex02 — Array:
Implement a class template Array<T> with dynamic memory, safe element access, deep copy, bounds checking, and a size() method. Mimic basic behavior of std::vector without using STL.
